# code-club
A repository for members to collaboratively work together while learning coding

The idea is
 * master  is the master - pristine copy
 * Coders work on their own branch, named after themselves
  * Working on their own code solutions
  * Merge regularly from master which has the documentationa and stock solutions for comparison
